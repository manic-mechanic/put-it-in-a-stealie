Create a simple website called “Put it in a Stealie"

The site will show an empty Stealie, one of the classic symbols in rock music. It’s in this folder as `/assets/stealie-bg-false-border-false-bolt-false-color-false-alt.png` and `/assets/stealie-bg-none-border-false-bolt-false-color-false.svg`

When empty, the center of the Stealie will show “+” or similar, to indicate to the user that they may add an image.

A user may then either drag and drop an image into that space (with visual indication) or tap on the space to bring up their files.

Following the image selection, the user will then crop the image to a circle, the size of the center of the Stealie

The completed Stealie will be shown.

User may then save the completed Stealie as a transparent PNG file, recrop the image inside, or replace the image with a new one that they will then crop.

This should work on desktop and mobile. For now this will be for my own local use but I may release it more widely in the future. I welcome input from you about preferable frameworks, stacks and libraries. Anything used should be popular, maintained, and well-documented.

This will be considered the MVP, and new features will be developed from there.

Write a step-by-step plan and feature list using best practices in accordance with this: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents

The plan should include testing of all pieces.

Initialize a git repository and make commits as needed. This will all be saved locally for now but eventually will be pushed to github.

Use the plugins at your disposal. Keep the code clear, simple, and easy to understand for an early-to-mid stage developer. The intention is to execute the creation of this webpage using a Ralph Wiggum loop. The front end design should be very simple, especially at this stage, but clean and good looking.
